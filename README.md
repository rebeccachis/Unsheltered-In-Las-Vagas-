This repository contains the capstone paper by Rebecca Chistol, which investigates the policy changes necessary to both increase housing availability for the unsheltered homeless and encourage their engagement with available services in Las Vegas, Nevada. The objective of this comprehensive analysis is to illuminate the issue and provide actionable insights for social workers, policymakers, and stakeholders. The paper features a thorough analysis of the current situation, an extensive literature review, and a set of policy recommendations. Additionally, the analysis incorporates data compiled in an Excel spreadsheet, which was recently created using the Southern Nevada Point In Time Homeless Census Results from 2020 to 2023, provided by Health Hope Home.## Table of Contents

## Introduction
The purpose of this memorandum is to explore ways to shelter more of the unsheltered homeless in Las Vegas. On February 1, 2020, an encampment ordinance (2019-36) was passed that mandates police officers to charge homeless people with a misdemeanor for camping or sleeping in all public places in Las Vegas. 

## Assessment of the Problem
In 2017, the annual homeless census revealed a 14 percent increase in the unsheltered homeless population in Las Vegas. It was also discovered that Las Vegas has the second highest shortage of affordable rental homes in the nation for the lowest-income households. Las Vegas Ordinance 2019-36 was passed November 6, 2019, to address these issues but the ordinance proved insufficient. The ordinance allowed only one night of shelter or temporary accommodation in courtyards, failing to create a stable living environment comparable to what encampments might offer.
## Literature Review
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development article entitled Understanding Encampments of People Experiencing Homelessness and Community Responses gives four reasons why the homeless choose encampments. The reason are lack of beds in the shelter, feeling safer with others who are encamping with them, having their independence and accessibility to drugs. One best practice for unsheltered homeless is Safe Outdoor Spaces in Denver, Colorado where tents are put up in a centralized area for the homeless ones to sleep. Another best practice is in Austin, Texas, where motels that are operational and fully furnished are bought to house homeless ones. Last best practice is Naviagation Centers in San Francisco, California, where vulnerable residents living on the streets who had not been open to traditional services are housed in containers. 

## Policy Recommendations
1.**Increase Affordable** Housing Units: Invest in the development of affordable housing units to provide stable living conditions for the homeless population.
2.**Expand Mental Health** and Substance Abuse Services: Enhance access to mental health services and substance abuse treatment programs to address the underlying issues contributing to homelessness.
3.**Implement Community**-Based Outreach Programs: Develop and support community outreach initiatives to connect homeless individuals with essential services and support systems.
## Conclusion
The data conclusively shows that, even after the completion of this paper several years ago, the homeless population in Las Vegas continues to increase. Furthermore, the number of unsheltered homeless individuals remains significantly higher than those in sheltered accommodations. Analyzing the data underscores the critical importance of collaboration between government agencies, organizations, and individuals in effectively addressing the homelessness crisis in Las Vegas. By implementing the recommended policies, it is feasible to substantially reduce the number of unsheltered homeless individuals and enhance their quality of life.
