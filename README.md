## Introduction
The purpose of this memorandum is to explore ways to shelter more of the unsheltered homeless in Las Vegas. On February 1, 2020, an encampment ordinance (2019-36) was passed that mandates police officers to charge homeless people with a misdemeanor for camping or sleeping in all public places in Las Vegas. 

## Assessment of the Problem
In 2017, the annual homeless census found that Las Vegas's unsheltered homeless population had increased by 14 percent. It was found that Lag Vags has the nation's second greatest shortage of rental homes that are affordable and available for the lowest-income households. Las Vagas Ordinance 2019-36 was passed on November 6, 2019 but it still created issues. The reason was it only gave homeless one night to spendd in shelters or courtyarsds but didn't create a stable living environment as encampment does. 

## Literature Review
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development article entitled Understanding Encampments of People Experiencing Homelessness and Community Responses gives four reasons why the homeless choose encampments. The reason are lack of beds in the shelter, feeling safer with others who are encamping with them, having their independence and accessibility to drugs. One best practice for unsheltered homeless is Safe Outdoor Spaces in Denver, Colorado where tents are put up in a centralized area for the homeless ones to sleep. Another best practice is in Austin, Texas, where motels that are operational and fully furnished are bought to house homeless ones. Last best practice is Naviagation Centers in San Francisco, California, where vulnerable residents living on the streets who had not been open to traditional services are housed in containers. 

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Increase Affordable Housing Units:** Invest in the development of affordable housing units to provide stable living conditions for the homeless.
2. **Expand Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services:** Enhance access to mental health services and substance abuse treatment programs to address underlying issues contributing to homelessness.
3. **Implement Community-Based Outreach Programs:** Develop and support community outreach initiatives to connect homeless individuals with necessary services and support.

## Conclusion
Collaboration between government agencies, organizations, and individuals is crucial to effectively address the issue of homelessness in Las Vegas. By implementing the recommended policies, it is possible to significantly reduce the number of unsheltered homeless individuals and improve their quality of life.
